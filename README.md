## 🖤 Identity

- **Name:** fsocietyx404  
- **Age:** 17  
- **Location:** Germany 🇩🇪  
- **Focus:** Cybersecurity / Offensive Security  
- **Primary Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Currently Strengthening:** C++ / C#  
- **Environment:** Linux-based systems  

I am focused on building a deep technical foundation.  
Not interested in surface-level knowledge or tool dependency.  
Goal: understand how systems behave internally — memory, processes, networking, and execution flow.

</p>

### Languages
- Python (automation, scripting, tool development)
- C++ (low-level logic, memory handling, system behavior)
- C# (structure & application development)

### Environment
- Linux CLI workflows  
- Bash scripting  
- Git version control  
- VS Code development setup  

---

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Focus Areas

- Network fundamentals & packet flow  
- Operating system structure  
- Process & memory behavior  
- Secure coding principles  
- Vulnerability concepts (buffer overflows, misconfigurations, logic flaws)  
- Automation of repetitive security tasks  

Long-term direction: offensive security with strong technical depth.

---

## 🧠 Current Development Path

- Building structured security utilities in Python  
- Writing small low-level C++ programs to understand memory & execution  
- Studying networking layers (TCP/IP, ports, services)  
- Improving debugging & problem-solving discipline  
- Learning how tools work internally rather than just running them  

---

## 🛠 Active Projects

- Security-focused Python scripts  
- Experimental automation frameworks  
- C++ system experiments  
- Structured learning repositories  

More complex tools and frameworks planned as knowledge deepens.
